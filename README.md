# OpenCv-Raspicam
This code can be used to capture imagesby raspicam using opencv. 
I have captured images from two picam's which were in sync to an NTP server. I got 20fps rate by using this script. 
We can also get 30fps or more, if we directly send the images to ROS as ROS packets from the stream instead of storing it.
